# Podscribe — Production Readiness & Showcase Plan

**Goal:** make Podscribe a flagship repo that reads convincingly to an **AI/ML Engineer**
hiring audience (applied AI, LLM/agent systems, ML pipelines, evaluation rigor).

**Guiding insight:** the gap between where this repo is and an "ideal" flagship is *not*
more features — the engineering is already strong (~5,400 LOC code vs ~5,200 LOC tests,
144 clean conventional commits, ADR + architecture docs, a documented audit→design→plan
workflow). The gap is **legibility**: making that quality visible in 60 seconds to a
reviewer who will *never install* an Apple-Silicon + Ollama + microphone stack.

Reviewer signals to maximize for the AI/ML-Engineer persona:
1. Builds reliably with LLMs/agents (✅ god-mode agent loop).
2. Measures model output quality (⚠️ seed exists in the ASR benchmark; needs an LLM eval).
3. Productionizes an ML pipeline (⚠️ needs CI, reproducibility, packaging polish).

## Phase 0 — Legibility & credibility (½–1 day) · **IN PROGRESS**

Zero intellectual cost, high signal. Removes the dead-ends in the 60-second scan.

### CI design (why it's built this way)

- **`test` job runs on `macos-latest` (Apple Silicon).** `mlx-whisper` only installs on
  Apple hardware, so ubuntu is not an option for the runtime tests. macOS runners are
  free for public repos. Runs `pytest -k "not transcriber"` to skip the one smoke test
  that downloads a real Whisper model.
- **`lint` job runs on `ubuntu-latest`** (ruff needs no ML deps → fast). `pyproject.toml`
  pins `target-version = "py310"`, so ruff *statically* rejects 3.10-incompatible syntax
  without needing a 3.10 runtime — this is how we prove the `requires-python >= 3.10`
  claim cheaply. (It already caught a real bug: a backslash inside an f-string expression,
  invalid before 3.12, latent because the dev interpreter is 3.14.)
- **Blocking ruff ruleset is the *correctness* subset** `E9, F63, F7, F82` — real bugs,
  not style. Verified clean. The broader style set is a tracked burn-down (below) so the
  badge is green today rather than red-on-arrival.

### Lint burn-down (13 advisory findings — safe, deferred)

All are `F401` (unused import) or `F541` (f-string without placeholder). Deferred from the
blocking gate because some "unused" imports may be re-export / test-monkeypatch seams that
need the full test suite (which requires Apple-Silicon deps) to remove safely. Triage each,
then widen `[tool.ruff.lint] select` to `["E", "F", "W", "I"]` and flip the gate.

```
agent.py:5            F401  shlex
agent_tools.py:296    F401  .llm.enhance_transcript   (verify not a patch seam)
agent_tools.py:342    F401  .llm.enhance_transcript   (verify not a patch seam)
audio.py:9,11,12      F401  collections / threading / time
cli.py:511            F541  empty f-string

tui.py:15             F401  tty

## Phase 1 — Proof it works without installing (1 day) · conversion

A reviewer won't run the stack; give them the result.

- **Asciinema/gif** of `record → show → enhance → consolidate`, driven off the committed
  `fixtures/asr/` clips so it reproduces without a mic. Embed at the top of README.
- **One-command demo path** (`make demo` or a script) that runs the *benchmark* on the
  committed fixtures and prints the table — lets a Linux/Windows reviewer watch the ML
  evaluation execute even though the live-mic path won't run for them.

---

## Phase 2 — The headline AI/ML contribution (2–4 days) · **depth** ⭐

The differentiator. Build an **evaluation of the LLM `enhance`/`consolidate` pipeline** —
not just ASR WER, but *generation quality*. This is the daily job of an AI/ML engineer
working with LLMs in production, and the raw materials already exist.

- **Hallucination / grounding rate.** `llm.py` already ships `ANTI_HALLUCINATION_PREAMBLE`
  and `SPEAKER_PRESERVATION_PREAMBLE` — now *measure whether they work*. Small labeled set
  of transcripts with known facts/names; run enhance with the preambles on vs off; report
  name-preservation accuracy, invented-fact rate, action-item-attribution accuracy.
- **Structured-extraction accuracy.** `consolidate` extracts YAML fields — measure
  field-level precision/recall against a gold set.
- **Quality-vs-latency Pareto.** Turn the documented "27B vs 8B" gut call
  (`Recommended_fixes.md` §3.1) into a measured table across 2–3 Ollama models.
- Write up as `docs/EVALS.md`, linked from README next to `BENCHMARKS.md`.

**Own the known weakness.** `docs/BENCHMARKS.md` shows the pipeline emits ~87% more words
than reference (VAD fragmentation). State it plainly and discuss mitigation — a candidate
who measures and openly reasons about a flaw in their own system reads as *more* senior,
not less.

---

## Phase 3 — Systems / production signal (1–2 days) · polish

- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** promoted from `AGENTS.md` (roadmap P8) — signals collaboration-ready.
- **Model-card-style writeup** (`docs/MODEL_CARD.md`): which models, why, known failure
  modes, intended use. Standard artifact AI/ML reviewers look for.
- Widen CI: matrix `[3.10, 3.12]` on the test job once wheel availability is confirmed;
  flip ruff to the full ruleset and add the mypy gate (see Phase 0 burn-down).

---

## Explicitly NOT doing (for this goal)

The Tier-3 product features from `Recommended_fixes.md` §5 (`prep`, `digest`, cross-pod
sentiment, perf-review draft) are great *product* ideas but read as "more app," not "more
AI/ML engineer." Ship at most **one** as a demo of the agent loop; a whole suite of them
distracts from the eval story (Phase 2) that actually differentiates the repo.

---

## Sequencing rationale

Phase 0 removes disqualifiers → Phase 1 gets the repo read → Phase 2 is the thing worth
remembering → Phase 3 is finish. **Phase 0 + Phase 2 alone** already put this ahead of most
candidate repos.

## Appendix — Cross-platform / NVIDIA support (deferred, not planned)

**Status: not being implemented.** Captured so the analysis isn't lost. Mirrored in
`roadmap.md` §7.

Podscribe is *not* truly Apple-Silicon-exclusive — only the ASR layer (`transcriber.py`,
via `mlx-whisper`/MLX/Metal) is. Everything else already ports:

| Layer | Apple-locked? | On Windows/NVIDIA |
|---|---|---|
| ASR (`transcriber.py`) | 🔴 yes | `mlx-whisper` → the entire port |
| LLM (`llm.py`, `agent.py`) via Ollama | 🟢 no | native on Windows+CUDA; *faster* on a 32 GB GPU |
| Audio + VAD (`audio.py`) | 🟢 no | `sounddevice`/PortAudio + `webrtcvad` run on Windows |
| Storage / CLI / TUI / search / export | 🟢 no | pure Python + `pathlib` + `os.replace` |

**The whole port = one pluggable ASR backend.** Refactor `transcriber.py` into a
`TranscriberBackend` protocol selected by hardware auto-detection:

```
Transcriber (protocol: transcribe(audio, initial_prompt) -> list[Segment])
├── MLXBackend            # mlx-whisper      — Apple Silicon (existing)
├── FasterWhisperBackend  # CTranslate2/CUDA — NVIDIA
└── CPUBackend            # faster-whisper int8 — universal fallback / CI
```

Package as extras: `pip install podscribe[mlx]` / `podscribe[cuda]`; auto-select MLX on
Darwin/arm64 → CUDA if `torch.cuda.is_available()` → CPU.

**NVIDIA ASR options (ranked):** faster-whisper (CTranslate2) — recommended, keeps
BENCHMARKS.md apples-to-apples; HF Transformers + PyTorch/CUDA — best bleeding-edge GPU
support; whisperX — adds diarization (roadmap goal; `.raw` already kept for it); NVIDIA
NeMo Parakeet/Canary — SOTA on NVIDIA, heavier.

⚠️ **RTX 5090 = Blackwell (sm_120), bleeding edge.** Needs CUDA 12.8+, recent cuDNN,
PyTorch 2.7+/nightly; CTranslate2 may lack sm_120 wheels. **Do a 1-hour engine spike first** —
this driver/wheel matrix is the port's only real risk, not the code.

**Windows edges (all small):** `msvcrt.locking`/temp-rename instead of POSIX `fcntl.flock`
(Recommended_fixes §2.6); `webrtcvad-wheels` or MSVC build tools, or upgrade to silero-VAD
(GPU, cross-platform); `colorama`/VT enablement for older consoles.

**Effort:** ~2–3 focused days of code, gated by the Blackwell spike.

**Why it's worth revisiting (ties into this doc's goal):** it converts the Apple-only
liability into two showcase assets — a broader hiring audience (any NVIDIA box can run it,
CI can run real ASR on Linux) and a **cross-accelerator benchmark** (M-series RTF vs RTX 5090
RTF) that upgrades the Phase 2 evaluation story.
